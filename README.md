### **Abstract**
Decomposition of animal carcasses provides unique and ephemeral resources that can cycle through ecosystems more efficiently than plant litter. Despite previous work demonstrating how the loss of apex consumers can affect carcass decomposition rates across landscapes and ecosystem productivity, the consequences of trophic downgrading for terrestrial biogeochemistry remain understudied. Using manipulative field experiments conducted across a natural gradient in Tasmanian devil density, we assessed how declines in apex scavenger populations influenced carcass persistence, soil biogeochemistry, and microbial ecology in summer and winter. Devil declines extended carcass persistence, concentrating carcass-derived nutrient input into soil, reducing soil microbiome diversity, and selecting for faster-growing taxa and pathogens. In the winter, lower invertebrate and microbial activity reduced carcass consumption regardless of devil populations, dampening soil biogeochemical responses. Further, while less efficient scavenger guilds clearly facilitated carcass consumption, they did not fill the functional role of apex scavengers. Our study highlights the unique role apex scavengers play in maintaining ecosystem function by linking decomposition dynamics with broader ecological consequences including plant productivity, carbon sequestration, and pathogen risk.


### **Data Description:**
Soil chemistry and microbial community data is from the top 7 cm of mineral soil collected from field sites across Tasmania in August-September 2022 ("Winter") or February-March 2023 ("Summer"). Complete experimental design, sampling, and analysis methods are described in the published manuscript.
